# Restaurant_Decider
This program is designed to end the "What do you want to eat" debate, once and for all



This project started as a discussion between my wife an I, though I imagine this is not unique to our household. The discussion was, where to eat tonight? It went something like this:

  “Where would you like to eat tonight?”
  “Well I don’t know… where do you want to eat?” 
  “Well we had X last night, and Y the other night. What sounds good to you?”
  … You can imagine the rest


I decided to create this project to end this discussion and frustration once and for all.


Run the main.py to get started! It opens up the main menu where you can have the program decide where you will eat tonight. If you want to view/add restaurants, open the "View" menu and follow the button prompts.
