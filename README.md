Program to help end the "What do you want to eat" debate, once and for all



This project started as a discussion between my wife an I, though I imagine this is not unique to our household. The discussion was, where to eat tonight? It went something like this:

  “Where would you like to eat tonight?”
  “Well I don’t know… where do you want to eat?” 
  “Well we had X last night, and Y the other night. What sounds good to you?”
  … You can imagine the rest


I decided to create this project to end this discussion and frustration once and for all.
