Program to help end the "What do you want to eat" debate, once and for all



This project started as a discussion between my wife an I, though I imagine this is not unique to our household. The discussion was, where to eat tonight? It went something like this:

  “Where would you like to eat tonight?”
  “Well I don’t know… where do you want to eat?” 
  “Well we had X last night, and Y the other night. What sounds good to you?”
  … You can imagine the rest


I decided to create this project to end this discussion and frustration once and for all.


UPDATE 1/18/23:
There are currently two active and running python scripts avialable
The main.py file is terminal based and fully functional. 
The guy.py file is a GUI version of the project and currently only returns values, which is the sole point of the project. The only issue is that you cannot edit or view the options for each meal option. This will be fixed in upcoming updates.
